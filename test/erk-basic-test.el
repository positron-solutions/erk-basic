;;; Commentary:

;; Run the batch tests from root directory:
;; nix shell .github#emacsGit --quick --script .github/run-shim.el -- test
;; Test dependencies can be provided to the Emacsen declared inside the root
;; flake.nix.

;; For local development, dependencies should be installed by the user.  Tests
;; can be run from one of the project files using the `erk-ert-project'
;; command.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'erk-basic)

(ert-deftest erk-basic-hello-test ()
  (should (string-match-p (erk-basic-hello)
                          "hello")))

(provide 'erk-basic-test)
;;; erk-basic-test.el ends here.
